# <h2>What is React.js?</h2>

React is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript toolkit for creating user interfaces based on Facebook Inc. components. It is also referred to as React.js or ReactJS. Meta (previously Facebook) and a group of independent developers and businesses are in charge of maintaining it.

With frameworks like Next.js, React may be used to create server-rendered, mobile, or single-page applications. React applications frequently rely on libraries for routing and other client-side functionality because React is only concerned with the user interface and rendering components to the DOM. One of React's main advantages is that it only re-renders the parts of the page that have changed, avoiding needless re-rendering of unchanged DOM elements. The initial launch date was May 29, 2013.

# <h3>Notable Features</h3>
React follows the declarative programming approach. React updates and displays components in response to data changes, and developers create views for every state of an application. On the other hand, imperative programming is different.

# <h4>Declarative</h4>
React code consists of modular and reusable components. React applications often include multiple levels of components. The components are rendered to a root element in the DOM via the React DOM framework. When rendering a component, values are exchanged across components using props (short for "properties"). A component's internal values are referred to as its state [15].

The two primary ways of declaring components in React are through function components and class components

# <h4>Function Components</h4>
Function components are defined as functions (using JavaScript function syntax or an arrow function expression) that take a single "props" parameter and return JSX. From React v16.8, function components can use state using the useState Hook.
